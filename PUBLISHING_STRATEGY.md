# PPP White Paper Publishing Strategy

**Author:** Paul Phillips, Clear Seas Solutions LLC
**Prepared:** January 2026
**Status:** Strategic Planning Document

---

## Executive Summary

Polytopal Projection Processing (PPP) represents a paradigm shift in computational cognition—from symbol manipulation to geometric process. This strategy outlines a multi-paper publication approach targeting academic venues, industry white papers, and defense/government audiences.

**Core Innovation:** The rendering pipeline *constitutes* cognition; visual projection of 4D polytopes is the thinking process itself.

**Key Differentiators:**
1. Geometric grounding solves symbol grounding problem
2. Interpretable by design (trajectories through polytope space)
3. Scale-invariant topology enables cross-domain transfer
4. Runs on commodity GPU hardware

**Mitigation:**
- Engage enactivist literature explicitly
- Provide formal definitions distinguishing PPP from visualization
- Include philosophical positioning section
- Anticipate and preempt objections

### Risk 3: Scooped by Related Work
**Concern:** Geometric deep learning community moves fast
**Mitigation:**
- arXiv preprint before journal submission
- Emphasize unique contributions (process-based, music grounding)

- Cite and differentiate from recent work

### Risk 4: Implementation Complexity
**Concern:** Reproducibility issues with 4D rendering
**Mitigation:**
- Release clean, documented code
