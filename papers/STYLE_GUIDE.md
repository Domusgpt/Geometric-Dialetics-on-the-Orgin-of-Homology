## Standardized Terminology

### Core Mathematical Structures

| Term | Definition | DO NOT USE |
|------|------------|------------|
| **E8 root lattice** | The unique even unimodular lattice in 8D with 240 root vectors | "E8 lattice" alone, "E8 space" |
| **Moxness Folding Matrix** | The 8×8 orthogonal matrix projecting E8 → H4 | "folding matrix", "projection matrix" |
| **H4 polytope family** | The 4D polytopes with icosahedral symmetry (600-cell, 120-cell) | "H4 group" (use "H4 Coxeter group" if referring to the group) |
| **600-cell** | Regular 4-polytope with 120 vertices, 720 edges, 1200 faces, 600 cells | "hexacosichoron" (use only in parenthetical) |
| **24-cell** | Self-dual regular 4-polytope with 24 vertices, 96 edges, 24 octahedral cells | "icositetrachoron" (use only in parenthetical) |
| **16-cell** | Regular 4-polytope with 8 vertices (4D analog of octahedron) | "hexadecachoron" |
| **Trinity Decomposition** | The partition of 24-cell into three disjoint 16-cells (α, β, γ) | "tripartite decomposition", "three-fold split" |
| **Phillips Synthesis** | Dialectical combination via visual compositing of 16-cell projections | "synthesis mechanism", "dialectical synthesis" |
| **Golden ratio** | φ = (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618034 | "phi", "golden mean", "golden number" |

### Physics Terminology

| Term | Definition | DO NOT USE |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Reduced phase space** | Phase space after applying conservation laws | "effective phase space" |
| **KS regularization** | Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation (3D Kepler → 4D oscillator) | "KS transform" alone |
| **D4 triality** | The S₃ outer automorphism of the D4 Lie algebra | "D4 symmetry" (ambiguous) |
| **Color confinement** | The phenomenon that quarks cannot exist in isolation | "quark confinement" |

### Cognitive/Computational Terminology

| Term | Definition | DO NOT USE |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Polytopal Projection Processing (PPP)** | The computational paradigm where rendering constitutes cognition | "polytope processing", "PPP framework" (redundant) |
| **Rendering-as-cognition** | The thesis that visual rendering IS cognitive computation | "rendering for cognition", "visual cognition" |
| **Stereographic projection** | The conformal map from 4D to 3D: x' = x/(1-w) | "stereo projection" |

## Core Principles (Must Be Consistent Across All Papers)

### Principle 1: Dimensional Correspondence
> The 8-dimensional reduced phase space of the planar three-body problem is homeomorphic to the E8 root lattice structure.

**Implication**: This is a structural correspondence, not mere dimensional coincidence.

### Principle 2: Geometric Crystallization
> Apparent chaos in low-dimensional observation is high-dimensional order. The Moxness Folding Matrix reveals this order by projecting E8 → H4.

**Implication**: Chaos is epistemic (observational), not ontic (fundamental).

### Principle 3: Trinity Structure
> The number THREE recurs throughout the framework due to D4 triality—the unique S₃ outer automorphism of a simple Lie algebra.

**Manifestations**:
- Three 16-cells in the 24-cell (Trinity Decomposition)
- Three fermion generations in the Standard Model
- Three color charges in QCD
- Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis in dialectical reasoning

### Principle 4: Golden Ratio Hierarchy
> The golden ratio φ connects scales: E8 = H4 ⊕ φ·H4

**Implication**: φ is not arbitrary but emerges from the algebraic structure of icosahedral symmetry.

### Principle 5: Rendering Constitutes Cognition
> The rendering pipeline (projection, compositing, rotation) IS cognitive computation, not visualization of pre-computed results.

**Implication**: The GPU is a geometric cognition engine, not merely a display accelerator.

### Principle 6: Convexity Requirement
> Stable equilibrium requires convex geometry. This is mathematical necessity, not empirical observation.

**Sources**: Thermodynamic stability, Kakutani fixed-point theorem, Brenier's theorem.
