## Standardized Terminology

### Core Mathematical Structures

| **600-cell** | Regular 4-polytope with 120 vertices, 720 edges, 1200 faces, 600 cells | "hexacosichoron" (use only in parenthetical) |
| **24-cell** | Self-dual regular 4-polytope with 24 vertices, 96 edges, 24 octahedral cells | "icositetrachoron" (use only in parenthetical) |
| **16-cell** | Regular 4-polytope with 8 vertices (4D analog of octahedron) | "hexadecachoron" |
| **Trinity Decomposition** | The partition of 24-cell into three disjoint 16-cells (α, β, γ) | "tripartite decomposition", "three-fold split" |
| **Phillips Synthesis** | Dialectical combination via visual compositing of 16-cell projections | "synthesis mechanism", "dialectical synthesis" |
| **Golden ratio** | φ = (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618034 | "phi", "golden mean", "golden number" |

### Physics Terminology

| Term | Definition | DO NOT USE |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Reduced phase space** | Phase space after applying conservation laws | "effective phase space" |
| **KS regularization** | Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation (3D Kepler → 4D oscillator) | "KS transform" alone |
| **D4 triality** | The S₃ outer automorphism of the D4 Lie algebra | "D4 symmetry" (ambiguous) |

### Cognitive/Computational Terminology

| Term | Definition | DO NOT USE |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Polytopal Projection Processing (PPP)** | The computational paradigm where rendering constitutes cognition | "polytope processing", "PPP framework" (redundant) |
| **Rendering-as-cognition** | The thesis that visual rendering IS cognitive computation | "rendering for cognition", "visual cognition" |
| **Stereographic projection** | The conformal map from 4D to 3D: x' = x/(1-w) | "stereo projection" |

## Core Principles (Must Be Consistent Across All Papers)

### Principle 1: Dimensional Correspondence
> The 8-dimensional reduced phase space of the planar three-body problem is homeomorphic to the E8 root lattice structure.

**Implication**: This is a structural correspondence, not mere dimensional coincidence.

### Principle 2: Geometric Crystallization
> Apparent chaos in low-dimensional observation is high-dimensional order. The Moxness Folding Matrix reveals this order by projecting E8 → H4.

**Implication**: Chaos is epistemic (observational), not ontic (fundamental).

### Principle 3: Trinity Structure
> The number THREE recurs throughout the framework due to D4 triality—the unique S₃ outer automorphism of a simple Lie algebra.

**Manifestations**:
- Three 16-cells in the 24-cell (Trinity Decomposition)
- Three fermion generations in the Standard Model
- Three color charges in QCD
- Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis in dialectical reasoning

### Principle 4: Golden Ratio Hierarchy
> The golden ratio φ connects scales: E8 = H4 ⊕ φ·H4

**Implication**: φ is not arbitrary but emerges from the algebraic structure of icosahedral symmetry.

### Principle 5: Rendering Constitutes Cognition
> The rendering pipeline (projection, compositing, rotation) IS cognitive computation, not visualization of pre-computed results.

**Implication**: The GPU is a geometric cognition engine, not merely a display accelerator.

### Principle 6: Convexity Requirement
> Stable equilibrium requires convex geometry. This is mathematical necessity, not empirical observation.

**Sources**: Thermodynamic stability, Kakutani fixed-point theorem, Brenier's theorem.

## Citation of Framework Components

### CRITICAL: Convergent Evolution Framing

The Trinity Decomposition was derived **independently** by Phillips via Music/Cognition research, NOT from physics. Ali (2025) provides **external validation**, not a source.

**Correct framing**: "Phillips's musical derivation converged with Ali's physics derivation"
**Incorrect framing**: "Phillips extended Ali's work" or "Based on Ali (2025)"

### Attribution Table

| Component | Attribution | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Trinity Decomposition** | Phillips (2025) | Original derivation via Music AI / Harmonic Ambiguity |
| **E8-H4 correspondence** | Phillips (2025-2026), building on Moxness (2014) | Graphics pipeline investigation |
| **E8 Lattice Graphics Pipeline** | Phillips (2025-2026) | Primary source for nested polytopal structure |
| **Phillips Synthesis** | Phillips (2025-2026) | Dialectic engine for CPE |
| **Triadic Coloring** | Phillips (2025-2026) | Discovered via PPP investigation |
| **Mirror Fermion Resolution** | Phillips (2025-2026) | H4_L/H4_R as matter/antimatter |
| **Rendering-as-cognition thesis** | Phillips (2025-2026) | Core PPP thesis |
| **24-cell particle mapping** | Ali (2025) | **External validation** of Trinity structure |

### The Convergent Evolution Statement

Use this text when explaining the relationship:

> "The Trinity Decomposition of the 24-cell was originally derived by Phillips (2025) in the context of computational musicology, to model harmonic ambiguity and dialectical tension. This derivation was subsequently found to be isomorphic to the matter-force decomposition in theoretical physics [Ali 2025]. The convergence of two independent derivations from completely different domains (Music/Cognition and High-Energy Physics) provides strong evidence for the universality of this geometric structure."

### Discovery Path (Required Attribution)

The developmental sequence:
1. **Chronomorphic Polytopal Engine** (Music AI Architecture) - Trinity Decomposition invented
2. **PPP** (Polytopal Projection Processing) - Rendering-as-cognition thesis
3. **E8 Lattice Graphics Pipeline** - E8 structure discovered via 4D rendering
4. **Physics applications** - Triality, generations, mirror resolution emerged from geometry
